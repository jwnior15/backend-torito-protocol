# ToritoWallet Integration - Changes Summary

## Overview
I have successfully integrated the ToritoWallet smart contract with the wallet deposit endpoint and extended the API with comprehensive contract functionality.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/utils/blockchain.js`
**Changes:**
- Added complete ToritoWallet contract ABI from your specification
- Added ToritoWallet contract initialization
- **New Methods Added:**
  - `depositToToritoContract()` - Handles USDT deposits to the contract
  - `withdrawFromToritoContract()` - Handles USDT withdrawals with collateral checks
  - `getToritoUserAccount()` - Retrieves user account data from contract
  - `requestLoanFromTorito()` - Handles BOB loan requests
  - `getUserLoanIds()` - Gets user's loan history
  - `calculateMaxBorrowable()` - Calculates borrowing capacity
  - `calculateRequiredCollateral()` - Calculates collateral requirements
  - `getContractStats()` - Gets contract statistics

### 2. `/routes/wallet.js`
**Changes:**
- **Modified Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/wallet/deposit` - Now uses ToritoWallet contract instead of direct Aave
  - `GET /api/wallet/balance` - Enhanced with ToritoWallet account data and contract stats
  - `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` - Now uses ToritoWallet contract with collateral validation
  - `GET /api/wallet/gas-estimate` - Updated operation types

- **New Endpoints Added:**
  - `POST /api/wallet/loan/request` - Request BOB loans with USDT collateral
  - `GET /api/wallet/loan/history` - Get user's loan history
  - `GET /api/wallet/borrowing-capacity` - Calculate and display borrowing capacity

### 3. `/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` (New File)
**Contents:**
- Complete API documentation for all endpoints
- Request/response examples
- Contract logic explanation
- Error handling documentation
- Environment variables requirements

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Contract Integration
- Full integration with ToritoWallet contract using provided ABI
- Automatic approval and transaction handling
- Event parsing for loan ID extraction
- Proper error handling with specific error messages

### 2. Enhanced Deposit Flow
- USDT deposit validation (checks user balance)
- Automatic approval of ToritoWallet contract to spend USDT
- Contract deposit call (which automatically supplies to Aave)
- Returns updated user account data

### 3. Comprehensive Withdrawal Logic
- Balance validation in ToritoWallet contract
- Collateral requirement calculations
- Prevents withdrawals that would leave insufficient collateral
- Rate-dependent calculations

### 4. BOB Loan System
- Loan request with collateral validation
- Borrowing capacity calculations (50% LTV)
- Automatic debt tracking
- Loan history management

### 5. Advanced Validation
- Exchange rate validation (USDT to BOB)
- Collateral sufficiency checks
- Borrowing capacity limits
- Account activation status

## Contract Functions Used

From your provided ABI, the API now integrates with:
- ✅ `deposit(uint256 amount)`
- ✅ `withdraw(uint256 amount, uint256 usdtToBobRate)`
- ✅ `requestLoan(uint256 bobAmount, uint256 usdtToBobRate)`
- ✅ `getUserAccount(address user)`
- ✅ `calculateMaxBorrowable(uint256 usdtBalance, uint256 usdtToBobRate)`
- ✅ `calculateRequiredCollateral(uint256 bobAmount, uint256 usdtToBobRate)`
- ✅ `getContractStats()`
- ✅ `getUserLoanIds(address user)`

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```env
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Your deployed ToritoWallet contract address
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
AAVE_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
USDT_ADDRESS=0x...
AUSDT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Error Handling Improvements

- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Proper blockchain error parsing
- Validation of all inputs before contract calls
- Development vs production error detail levels

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy your ToritoWallet contract and test all endpoints
2. **Environment Setup**: Update your `.env` file with the contract address
3. **Rate Integration**: Implement a service to fetch real-time USDT to BOB exchange rates
4. **Frontend Integration**: Update your mobile app to use the new API endpoints
5. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for contract events and transactions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test deposit flow with small amounts first
2. Verify withdrawal collateral calculations
3. Test loan request scenarios (sufficient/insufficient collateral)
4. Check edge cases (zero balances, maximum borrowing)
5. Validate gas estimates match actual usage

The integration is now complete and ready for testing! All endpoints follow the contract's logic and handle the specific decimal precision requirements (USDT: 6 decimals, BOB: 2 decimals, Rate: 8 decimals).
